  \begin{block}{}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{It's easy to measure the sky coordinates RA and DEC of each object.}
      \item{But we also want to know how far away the object is, to place it properly in three-dimensional space.}
      \item{The expansion of the Universe `stretches' lightwaves, making the wavelength longer (redder). This is `cosmological redshift'.}
      \item{From the redshift we can infer the distance (more redshift $\implies$ more distant).}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

% Can I find a picture of cosmological redshift to add here?

\begin{frame}{Photometric redshifts}
  \begin{block}{}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{If we could point a spectrograph at each object, then we could precisely measure the redshift noting how much the spectral lines have shifted.}
      \item{This would take too long!}
      \item{But we get some (very coarse) spectral information by measuring the brightness through each of the five filters.}
      \item{From this we can get a `good enough' estimate of the redshift.}
      \item{What can go wrong: small old nearby red galaxy and large old distant blue galaxy are indistinguishable.}

      \item{What is the mass of the neutrino?}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Cosmological questions that we don't work on}
  \begin{block}{}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{How big is the Universe?}
      \item{What caused the Big Bang?}
      \item{Are there other Universes?}
    \end{itemize}
    We (currently) have no tools to use to answer these questions.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{First principles}
  There is strong evidence that:
  \begin{block}{}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{There was a Big Bang - an initial hot and dense state - and the Universe has been expanding ever since.}
      \item{The Universe is more-or-less the same everywhere and we are not in a `special' location.}
      \item{Einstein's theory (`General Relativity') correctly describes how gravity works.}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{So how can we answer these comological questions?}
  \begin{block}{}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{One main method is to look at how `clustered' galaxies are.}
      \item{Galaxies aren't randomly distributed through space - instead, they cluster together under the influence of gravity.}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

\begin{frame}{Clustering}
  \begin{block}{}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{The older the Universe, the longer time gravity has had to operate, so the more clustering.}
      \item{The more stuff in the Universe, the more gravity, so the more clustering.}
      \item{The two effects are similar but distinguishable.}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{So here's the plan}
  \begin{block}{}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{We agree on a definition of clustering.}
      \item{Theoretical astrophysicists calculate how much clustering they would expect for a range of ages and densities.}
      \item{Astronomers measure how much clustering there actually is.}
      \item{We match the results to see which age/density combination makes theory equal observation.}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

\begin{frame}{Clustering}
  \begin{block}{}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{Measure the distance between each pair of objects. Expect to see lots of pairs with small separation.}
      \item{Draw a histogram of the results.}
      \item{Repeat using randomly positioned objects.}
      \item{Look at the percentage difference between the two histograms.}

% Do clustering exercise



\begin{frame}{Conclusions of our exercise}
  \begin{block}{}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{Universe is about 14 billion years old.}
      \item{Density of matter is about 4 g per Jupiter volume.}

\begin{frame}{What types of stuff?}
  \begin{block}{}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{Our actual analysis is more complicated.}
      \item{The theoreticians actually create clustering graphs for a huge range of densities for different possible types of `stuff'. }
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Dark matter}
  \begin{block}{}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{They include the possibility that some of the matter doesn't interact with light.}
	\item{Such `dark matter' doesn't cluster as easily as ordinary matter. \color{blue}{Why not?}}
      \item{This gives a recognisable signature in the clustering graph.}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Dark energy}
  \begin{block}{}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{They also include the possibility that empty space itself has some mass.}
	\item{This mass is called `dark energy'.}
      \item{This mass is everywhere, and can't cause clustering.}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}
      
\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
  \begin{block}{}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{If we throw all these stange things into the range of possibilities, then we find that the best match to the observed clustering is:}
	\item{Age of Universe = 14 billion years (as before).}
      \item{Of the 4.3 g per Jupiter volume of matter, only 0.7 g is normal matter (basically hydrogen and helium) and 3.6 g is dark.}
      \item{As well, empty space has a mass of 9 g per Jupiter volume.}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Dark Energy}
  \begin{block}{}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{Dark energy is not well understood.}
	\item{Normally you must expend energy to increase a volume (think of the piston on a steam locomotive).}
      \item{But dark energy \textit{increases} as space expands. Thus we say that dark energy has a \textit{negative} pressure.}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Cosmic acceleration}
  \begin{block}{}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{Analysis of the Dark Energy Survey results shows that this pressure is exactly the negative of the energy density (the two quantities have the same units).}
      \item{This negative pressure causes an \textit{acceleration} in the expansion of space.}
      \item{This acceleration was first observed in the 1990s.}
      \item{The accelaeration has been slowly building for the last five billion years.}
      \item{This will dominate the future Universe - in the distant future our galaxy will have no near neighbours.}
    \end{itemize}
